<a name="aboutme">About Me</a>
=============================

I live and work in Brisbane, Australia, with my family, a dog and two cats.

My alma mater is [Curtin University](https://www.curtin.edu.au/) in Perth, Australia.  

I graduated from there twice, first as a
- B.Sc. (Computer Science) in 1992, and later
- B.A. (Communications and Cultural Studies) in 2002.

My first computer was a [John Sands SEGA SC-3000 Personal Computer](https://dev.to/buntine/the-historical-obscurity-of-the-sega-sc-3000-personal-computer-1hac) 
(no really, this thing existed).
It came with a BASIC interpreter on a cartridge, and a magazine about structured programming that taught me to use GOSUB
rather than GOTO.

My first student language was [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal), on a [Commodore PC-5 PC/XT Clone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PC_compatible_systems)
that I bought from KMart with pocket money I saved at high-school (true story).  It had two floppy drives, and no hard disk.

My first professional programming language was [Borland Turbo C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Turbo_C), and 
I accidentally deleted nine months of code, that I didn't have a copy of ([UNDELETE](https://web.csulb.edu/~murdock/undelete.html)).

My first object-oriented language was the [TOOL (Transaction Object Oriented Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forte_4GL)
that shipped with Forte 4GL.  It supported source control, embedded (inline) SQL, remote singletons (service objects), 
 distributed events and cross-platform client-server applications straight out of the box. It was pretty cool, until Sun Microsystems acquired and sunk it.

For this, and no sensible other reason, I still hate on Java and all things JEE.  The [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) saved Java from 
itself, and handed me back the familiar design paradigm I had before, but with too much XML.

My language of choice for many years was Groovy, because closures and duck-typing proved beyond measure that
the benefit of static typing is mostly a lie perpetrated by non-functional developers who don't write tests.

JavaScript has replaced Groovy as my first language (sorry Groovy, I still love you), because:
- its an open standard,
- its isomorphic,
- its functional,
- its duck-typed,
- its cross-platform.

I also have a meaningful life outside software.  I love my dog, but am and always have been a cat person.

You can find me on LinkedIn, Twitter and Gmail with the @craigparra handle &ndash; though, if you do want to email me, craigparra+alt-javascript is preferred.
